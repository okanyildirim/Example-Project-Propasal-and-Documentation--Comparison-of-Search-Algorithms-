# An Experimental Analysis for Comparison of Searching Algorithms 

In this project, we compared three different search algorithms in terms of their run times. For this comparison we have written and compiled all the algorithms in the C ++ programming language. 

For all these tests we used data sets of 1K, 10K, 100K and 1M respectively. We also analyzed all these codes in the Windows operating system, then Linux, and finally in the OS-X operating system. 

Windows: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20 GHz 2.19 GHz 

Linux: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2300 CPU @ 2.80GHz x 4 

Mac: 1,4 GHz Intel Core i5 

Finally, we have made suggestions about which algorithm works better by converting the results we obtained from these experiments into graphs.
